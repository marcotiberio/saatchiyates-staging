Biosdetail: Benjamin Spiers was born in Plymouth, in 1972. He studied at Falmouth University and later Goldsmiths in London, under Peter Doigâ€™s tutorage. His paintings pair methodical skills, with a mastery of styles that include surrealism, abstraction and cubism, bringing alive a world of hypnagogic fears and fantasies to his canvasses. His subjects are seemingly at ease with their outlandish grotesque countenances, their bulging necks, twisted limbs, and vibrant eyes beckon the viewer into the deranged magical world where they reside.
