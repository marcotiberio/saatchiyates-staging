Biosdetail:

Hams Klemens is part of an art collective titled “Modern Jazz”, alongisde artists Jin Angdoo, Mathieu Julien, and Kevin Pinsembert, based between Paris and Marseille. Klemens’ largest body of work to date, exists in a tunnel underneath Marseille, where he creates giant abstract paintings using abandoned household paint cans, and handmade brush contraptions which stretch ten-foot-tall. Inspired by the children of the Marseille Projects, who he teaches art, his work is full of childlike marks and gestures. Klemens’ rough take on abstract expressionism is reminiscent of exuberant landscapes, floral chaos or trembling water. They seem to be hallucinations of flickering landscapes in an otherwise dark, jerking techno club.

Klemens currently lives and works in Marseille.
